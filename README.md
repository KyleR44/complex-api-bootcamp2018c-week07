## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

With this project I approached the idea first and looked outside the box as to who i wanted to target, i approached the JavaScript first and then structured my html.

## Optimizations

If I had more time i would try to make it look more appealing  to the user

## Lessons Learned:

i learned the importance of time management because i ran out of time
